# Spotify-DJ-Requests
Simple pyhton script that allows the crowd to send in songs through the use of a public spotify playlist of your choice. My program will then poll that playlist regulary, grab any new songs added and outmatically download them onto your laptop. This way you can fulfill any resuest (assuming you are DJing with a laptop) while still DJing!
